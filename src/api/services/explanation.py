"""Grounded explanation generation (FR-9 stand-in for US-208 / feeds US-404).

Generates a narrative recommendation explanation composed ONLY from the stored
evidence chain: every sentence is emitted together with the source it is
grounded in (a policy clause source_id, an applicant field, a risk factor, the
regulatory verdict, or a document finding). Because the text is assembled from
evidence rather than free-generated, it is grounded by construction - which is
exactly what the faithfulness harness (hallucination_eval.py) verifies.

When an LLM is later adopted for richer prose, it must consume the same
``claims`` structure and its output must pass the same harness before release.
